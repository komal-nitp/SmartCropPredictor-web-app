# 🌾 CropPredict – ML-Based Crop Recommendation Web App

**Duration:** Mar 2025 – Apr 2025  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

---

## 🚀 Overview

**CropPredict** is a machine learning–powered web application that helps users (especially farmers and agricultural analysts) predict the most suitable crop to grow based on **soil** and **climatic conditions**.

By inputting parameters such as:
- Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
- pH value of the soil
- Rainfall
- Temperature

The app predicts the **best crop** recommendation using trained classification models. This tool supports **data-driven agriculture** and improves decision-making for crop selection.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ ML-based crop recommendation
- 🌱 User-friendly input form for soil and climate data
- 📊 Real-time predictions using trained ML models
- 📉 Regression models to understand feature impact on crop types
- 💻 Developed with Flask backend and responsive HTML/CSS frontend

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **ML Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Algorithms Used:** Classification (Decision Tree, Random Forest), Regression

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **User Inputs:** Soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, temperature, and rainfall.
2. **ML Model:** Uses pre-trained classifier to recommend the best crop.
3. **UI/UX:** Built with Flask templates and styled using HTML/CSS for ease of use.
4. **Output:** Displays the crop name predicted with relevant context.
